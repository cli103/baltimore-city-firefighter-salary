Step-by-step Excel Instructions
1. Import the data from the Baltimore City Government into Excel
2. Filter the data by job title and selected only ‘EMT Firefighter’ and ‘EMT Fire Fighter’
3. Copy this data to a separate excel sheet labelled ‘firefighters-data’
4. Generate a pivot table with the data for a quick overview of the relevant data
      a. In rows put ‘FiscalYear’, and put ‘AnnualSalary’ and ‘GrossPay’ in values
      b. Convert both the ‘AnnualSalary’ and ‘GrossPay’ columns into averages
5. Copy the data from the pivot table on annual and paste it into a separate excel sheet labelled ‘simplereg-vis’
      a. Create a fiscal year column from 2011 – 2020
      b. Pasted the average annual salary into the corresponding years as values
      c. Create a column ‘Average of Annual Salary Previous Year’ and paste the data into the corresponding years again
      d. Remove 2011 as there was no data from the previous year
6. Create a scatterplot using this data with the ‘Average of Annual Salary Previous Year’ as the x variable and the ‘Average Annual Salary’ as the y variable
      a. Add graph and axes titles
      b. Add a trend line and the corresponding equation and r squared value
      c. Calculate the standard error of the residual
7. Performed a similar linear regression analysis for gross pay and gross pay of the previous year
      a. Repeat steps 5-6 for this analysis
8. For the multiple regression analysis, use the data for ‘Average of Annual Salary Previous Year’, ‘Average of Gross Pay’ and ‘Average of Gross Pay Previous Year’ 
      a. Use the Excel Data Analysis ToolPak to perform a multiple linear regression analysis on the data and generated the results to a new sheet ‘multiplereg-analysis’
